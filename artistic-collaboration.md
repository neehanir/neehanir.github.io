![Artistic Collaboration](/img/graffiti.jpg){: .page-hero-image}

I believe art is a conversation, and I am open to artistic collaboration with creators who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of expression and narrative.

If you are a fellow artist or visionary looking to merge perspectives, these are the primary areas where I find common ground, though my door remains open to other creative avenues that spark a unique connection:

- **Sonic Landscapes:** I am available for collaboration as a vocalist or flutist, whether for formal compositions, improvisational sessions, or experimental layering.
- **Narrative & Concept:** I enjoy partnering on the core storytelling and artistic vision of a project to help bridge the gap between a raw idea and a finished, cohesive experience.
- **Digital Integration:** I am interested in merging digital art with other mediums to create multi-sensory works or visual accompaniments to performance and sound.

I approach every potential partnership with an open mind and a focus on storytelling, seeking projects where our diverse skills can combine to create something neither of us could achieve alone. If your work aligns with these disciplines, or moves in a direction I haven't explored yet, I welcome the opportunity to connect!

### Statement on Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In an era where the lines between human and machine-generated content are increasingly blurred, I believe in maintaining the highest level of artistic integrity and transparency. I do not use Artificial Intelligence to generate any of my artistic works. Every piece of music, every story, and every visual work or image presented as my own is an original creation, born from my personal practice and expertise. Should a project involve a co-creator, they will be explicitly credited. My commitment to you is that the art we explore together is rooted in authentic human experience and the genuine creative process.
