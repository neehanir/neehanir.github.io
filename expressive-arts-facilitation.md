![Expressive Arts Facilitation](/img/recital.jpg){: .page-hero-image}

As a multifaceted educator and creative facilitator, I am dedicated to fostering personal growth, healing, and connection through the power of the arts. With over nine years of teaching experience, training in Music Therapy, a BA in Music, and a variety of experiences in dance, visual art, writing, drama, and nature-based practices, I have evolved my practice from traditional music instruction into a holistic, intermodal expressive arts approach. My work focuses on providing a safe, co-creative space where you can explore your inner world and find your unique creative voice for healing and growth.

## My Holistic & Intermodal Approach

My sessions transcend the boundaries of any single medium. While my foundation is rooted in extensive training across various musical traditions, I now integrate storytelling, world-building, poetry, visual arts, imagination play, nature-based practices, and movement.

I also incorporate positive reinforcement throughout my facilitation. Whether we are composing music to accompany your poetry or using visual arts to map out complex characters and settings, I will guide you in weaving different artistic threads into a cohesive, expressive tapestry.

## Cultivating Wellness and Connection

At the heart of my practice is a commitment to mindfulness and emotional well-being. Every session begins and ends with guided meditation, breathing exercises, intention setting or grounding activities. This intentional structure ensures that our creative process is always rooted in presence and self-awareness.

**I especially enjoy working with:**

- **Neurodivergent Individuals:** Using the arts as a vital outlet for thoughts and feelings that may be difficult to communicate verbally.
- **Those Struggling with Grief and Post Traumatic Stress:** Utilizing creative expression to process loss and trauma.
- **Couples, Friends and Families:** Facilitating shared creative experiences designed to strengthen bonds, foster empathy, and encourage collective growth.
- **Animal Lovers:** Using artistic expression to explore the human-animal bond and the unique experience of being caretakers to animal companions.

## A Co-Creative Partnership

I move away from the traditional "teacher-student" hierarchy, viewing my role instead as a facilitator within a co-creative partnership. I invite you to take the lead in your creative direction, ensuring the space is responsive to your current emotional state and long-term aspirations.

By combining technical expertise with compassionate mentorship, I aim to equip you with a comprehensive toolkit for both artistic success and holistic development. Through this personalized lens, I help individuals of all ages transform "big feelings" into meaningful art, building confidence, resilience, and a deeper connection to themselves and others.

### Scope of Practice and Professional Boundaries

While I am deeply passionate about using the expressive arts to support individuals navigating neurodivergency, grief, post traumatic stress and personal growth, please be advised that I am not a licensed psychotherapist, psychologist, or medical doctor. My services are facilitative and educational in nature, focusing on creative expression and personal exploration. Due to the deep, introspective nature of the expressive arts, powerful emotions may arise during our sessions. I am not trained to provide clinical psychiatric diagnosis or treatment, and I highly encourage clients to seek support from licensed mental health professionals for therapeutic needs. Working with a professional therapist or social worker in conjunction with our artistic exploration can be a powerful way to support your holistic well-being. I am happy to provide a list of local mental health resources and organizations upon request.
