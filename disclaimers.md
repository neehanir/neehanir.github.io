## Scope of Practice and Professional Boundaries

While I am deeply passionate about using the expressive arts to support individuals navigating neurodivergency, grief, post traumatic stress and personal growth, please be advised that I am not a licensed psychotherapist, psychologist, or medical doctor. My services are facilitative and educational in nature, focusing on creative expression and personal exploration. Due to the deep, introspective nature of the expressive arts, powerful emotions may arise during our sessions. I am not trained to provide clinical psychiatric diagnosis or treatment, and I highly encourage clients to seek support from licensed mental health professionals for therapeutic needs. Working with a professional therapist or social worker in conjunction with our artistic exploration can be a powerful way to support your holistic well-being. I am happy to assist clients in locating mental health resources and organizations best fit for their needs.

## Statement on Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In an era where the lines between human and machine-generated content are increasingly blurred, I believe in maintaining the highest level of artistic integrity and transparency. I do not use Artificial Intelligence to generate any of my artistic works. Every piece of music, every story, and every visual work or image presented as my own is an original creation, born from my personal practice and expertise. Should a project involve a co-creator, they will be explicitly credited. My commitment to you is that the art we explore together is rooted in authentic human experience and the genuine creative process.
