## Neeharika Aniruddh

Neeharika Aniruddh is an Intermodal Expressive Artist, Educator, and Facilitator whose work lives at the intersection of creative expression and advocacy. Her practice is deeply rooted in her lived experience as a womxn of color navigating the complexities of chronic illness, neurodivergence, and cross-cultural identity.

Neeharika uses a multi-modal approach, weaving together musical storytelling with digital and physical arts, movement, and nature-based practices, to build worlds that explore the complexities of the human condition, focusing on topics such as disenfranchised grief, post traumatic stress, interpersonal relationships, companionship with animals, nostalgia, and the passage of time. Integrating her lived experience and training with a compassionate approach, Neeharika examines her own internal landscape and outward journey, and prompts a collective reflection on our shared human experience and the way we engage with the world.

With a BA in Music and training in music therapy, Neeharika's musical foundation is as diverse as it is deep. Her sonic palette is defined by a constant, curious exploration: blending her formal training in Hindustani classical traditions and Western Art music with an ever-evolving interest in new styles. Through her exploration of genres, she creates a sound that is both technically grounded and experimental. Driven by the belief that the arts belong to the people, she centers her work on folkloric music as a vessel for community storytelling and collective healing.

Neeharika's dedication to well-being extends beyond the human experience. As a Certified Animal Training and Enrichment Professional (CATEP), she is a passionate advocate for animal rights and mental health support for animal lovers.

Neeharika is currently actively expanding her artistic portfolio. Alongside this creative output, she is refining her expressive arts facilitation techniques and deepening her research in Ethnomusicology. Her research interests focus on exploring sociocultural identity through music and the arts, focusing on driving questions such as *"what does music mean to the people who create and live with it?"* Driven by a commitment to lifelong learning and service, she aims to pursue an MSW and seeks to expand her training in expressive arts, with the long-term vision of doctoral research in Ethnomusicology.
